# ScratchHook Documentation
ScratchHook has three types of blocks:
 - **[Webhook | Command Block]** Data (BOOLEAN) URL (STRING)
    - The Boolean area is where you insert the data boolean and/or connector boolean.
 - **[Data | Boolean Block]** (MENU) (STRING)
    - The Menu area currently has three options, ("Content","Name","Icon").
        - When choosing "Content", you will type in the text you want to send to the string part of the boolean.
        - When choosing "Name", you will type in the name of the webhook you want to set to the string part of the boolean.
        - When choosing "Icon", you will type in the link to the image you want to set as the profile picture of the webhook.
    - ## **NOTE: "Name" AND "Icon" ARE NOT NECESSARY TO BE SENT, YOU NEED TO AT LEAST HAVE "Content" AS A DATA SET!**
 - **[Connector | Boolean Block]** (BOOLEAN1) , (BOOLEAN2)
    - This Boolean connects two *different* Data Booleans together so you can send multiple pieces of data to the webhook.
